## EthenaCredit

## Title
EthenaCredit is an Undercollateralise lending platform that gives out more loan to users than their collateral. While this system provides a valuable service, several challenges hinder its efficiency and user experience:



## Problem

Title: Over Collateralise Lending Protocol 
Bullets:
Complex Application Process: The requirement for detailed property information from ChainProperty can overwhelm users, leading to incomplete submissions and delays in loan approval.

Inefficient Loan Verification: The current loan verification process may be slow, resulting in longer wait times for businesses in need of immediate financial support.

Delayed Fund Disbursement: After loan approval, ensuring prompt and accurate disbursement of funds is critical to meeting the operational needs of businesses.

Proposed Solution
To address these challenges, we propose the following solutions:

Streamlined Application Process: Simplify the application interface to guide users step-by-step through the submission of property information. Incorporate tooltips and examples to assist users in providing complete and accurate data.


Clear Payback Option Guidance: Introduce an interactive loan calculator that visually demonstrates the impact of different payback periods on monthly payments and total interest. This tool will help users make informed decisions about their loan options.

Rapid Fund Disbursement System: Develop an automated disbursement mechanism that ensures funds are released promptly after approval. Establish clear timelines for disbursement and keep users informed throughout the process.
